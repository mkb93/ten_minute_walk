# ten_minute_walk

a function that returns true if the walk takes 10 minutes and returns me to my starting point


['n','s','w','e'] are the strings given they represent north south, east and west.
it will give a  valid array as input 
the length of the array can vary but is never 0 (testing done)
after completing all the inputs I will end up in the same location ( meaning that if i go north i have go south and if i go east i have to go west)
i want it be length 10
